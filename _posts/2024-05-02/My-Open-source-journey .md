"My journey in open source began when I came across a post inviting applications for cohorts. Intrigued, I read more about it and decided to apply. However, after submitting my application, I became preoccupied with work and other commitments, causing me to forget about it. You may wonder why I applied in the first place. Well, I have been actively contributing to tech communities through mentorship and organizing meetups. I have also heard about open source contributions, particularly from individuals like Afi Maame, Ruth Ikegah, and Mesrenyame. Although I understand that contributing to tech communities is considered open source contribution, I was curious about platforms like GitHub, which is why I applied.

The learning process was smooth, and I acquired numerous skills, especially in GitHub.

Stay tuned for more updates after the conclusion of this journey!"
