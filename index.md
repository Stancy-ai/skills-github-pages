title: My All in Africa Journey
---
My journey in open source in Africa began when I stumbled upon a post via X inviting applications for cohorts. Intrigued, I read more about it and decided to apply. However, after submitting my application, I got caught up with work and other commitments, and I almost forgot about it. You might wonder why I applied in the first place. Well, I have been actively involved in the tech community through mentorship and organizing meetups. I had heard about open source contributions, especially from individuals like Afi Maame, Ruth Ikegah, and Mesrenyame. While I understood that contributing to the tech community also constitutes open source contributions, I was curious about platforms like GitHub. That's why I decided to apply.

I am thoroughly enjoying this journey so far; the course has been smooth, and I am learning a lot. Currently, I am active on my GitHub pages
Stay tuned for more updates after the conclusion of this journey!
